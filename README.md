# E-Voting System in C

A console-based electronic voting system developed in C as part of the Programming Fundamentals course at COMSATS University.

## Features

- User registration with eligibility checks (age, semester, department)
- Candidate registration with department-level uniqueness
- Secure voting that prevents self-voting and duplicate votes
- Admin login to view votes, results, and determine election winner
- Persistent storage using text files (`members.txt`, `voters.txt`)
- ASCII-style graphical result display
- Candidate search by department
- Terms and conditions agreement required for candidates

## Technologies Used

- C Programming Language
- File handling in C
- Custom data structures (`struct`)
- Basic authentication logic
